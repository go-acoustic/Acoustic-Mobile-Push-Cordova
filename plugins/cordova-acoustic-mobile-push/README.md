## Install Acoustic Campaign Cordova plug-in

1. Add `cordova-acoustic-mobile-push` from the project.

```shell npm
npm i cordova-acoustic-mobile-push
```

## Update CampaignConfig.json

After the plugin is installed, `CampaignConfig.json` file will be created if not found on the root of the project. Example screenshot of the file and the json properties:

For production Campaign SDKs, set "useRelease" to true, false uses beta build.  Note: It's recommended to set the property to "false" during testing phase.

```shell json
  "useRelease": true,
```

## Set up your Android project
1. For Android Campaign SDK version, update "androidVersion" if you need a version which is not the latest. Otherwise leave it blank to get the latest.
```shell json
  "androidVersion": "x.x.x",
```
2. Copy your `google-services.json` file with your Google-provided FCM credentials to your android project folder: `platforms/android/app/google-services.json`.
3. Edit `CampaignConfig.json` file in `android` section and fill in the `baseUrl` and `appKey` provided by your account team.
```json
"baseUrl": "https://mobile-sdk-lib-XX-Y.brilliantcollector.com",
"appKey": {
  "prod": "INSERT APP KEY HERE"
},
```
4. Run node.js command from project's folder to automatically apply all updates in the json file
```text shell
node node_modules/cordova-acoustic-mobile-push/scripts/installPlugins.js
```
5. Build Android application in cordova
```text shell
cordova build android
```
6. Launch Android app.
```text shell
cordova run android
```

## Set up your iOS project
> ðŸ“˜ Note:
> 
> The iOS Simulator is unable to handle push messages.
1. For iOS Campaign SDK version, update "iOSVersion" if you need a version which is not the latest. Otherwise leave it blank to get the latest.
```shell json
  "iOSVersion": "x.x.x",
```
2. Open the iOS project in Xcode.
3. Fix up the `bundle ID and signing` to use a bundle ID and profile with appropriate capabilities.
4. Add the `Push Notification` capability to your project: Go to **Signing & Capabilities**, Click **+Capability **, and select **Push Notification**.
5. Turn on the `Location Updates` background mode to your project: Go to **Signing & Capabilities** and check **Location Updates** checkbox.
6. Edit `CampaignConfig.json` file in `iOS` section and fill in the `baseUrl` and `appKey` provided by your account team.

```json
"baseUrl": "https://mobile-sdk-lib-XX-Y.brilliantcollector.com",
"appKey": {
  "dev": "INSERT APP KEY HERE",
  "prod": "INSERT APP KEY HERE"
},
```
7. Run node.js command from project's folder to automatically apply all updates in the json file
```text shell
node node_modules/cordova-acoustic-mobile-push/scripts/installPlugins.js
```
8. Build iOS application in cordova
```text shell
cordova build ios
```
9. Launch Android app.
```text shell
cordova run ios
```

## Optional: Integrating the iOS notification service

The iOS notification service requires separate provisioning. This plug-in is required if you need to access **push received events**, **dynamic action categories**, and **media attachments**. 

1. Edit `CampaignConfig.json` file and set to `true` to `cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-ios-notification-service`
```json
"cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-ios-notification-service": true,
```
2. Run node.js command from project's folder to automatically apply all updates in the json file
```text shell
node node_modules/cordova-acoustic-mobile-push/scripts/installPlugins.js
```
3. Build iOS application in cordova which will also update cocoapod depedencies.
```text shell
cordova build ios
```
3. Add a new `Notification Service Extension` target:  
   a. In your XCode project, go to the **File** menu and select **New > Target**. A dialog box opens.  
   b. In the dialog box, select **iOS** at the top and then select **Notification Service Extension**.  
   c.  Select **Next**, enter the extension name `NewAppNotificationService`, and choose **Objective-C **as  
   **Language**.  
   d. Click **Finish**. If a dialog box opens, select **Activate**. The new target is added to the project. Xcode created a new folder with files in it.  
   e. Change the new target bundle identifier prefix and use `.notification`.  
   f. Verify that the new target has the same iOS version as the application target. SDK minimum supported version is 13.0.  
   g. Add the _MceConfig.json_ file to the **Notification Service** target. Open the file and check the notification service target membership in the **Target Membership** of the **File Inspector** in the Xcode pane.  
   h. Add `-ObjC` to the **Other Linker Flags** build options for the Notification Service.  
   d. Add `App Group` capability to both your notification service extension and Application target. Be sure to use the same app group as the main application.  
   e. Add the `Keychain Sharing capability` to both your notification service extension and Application target. Be sure to use the same value as the main application.  
   f. Replace the contents of _NotificationService.m_ and _NotificationService.h_ with the following code:

```javascript NotificationService.h
// NotificationService.h
#import <UserNotifications/UserNotifications.h>
#import <AcousticMobilePushNotification/AcousticMobilePushNotification.h>

@interface NotificationService : MCENotificationService

@end
```
```javascript NotificationService.m
// NotificationService.m
#import "NotificationService.h"

@implementation NotificationService

@end
```

## Add other Campaign features

1. To add other features, update the 'plugins' section in the 'CampaignConfig.json' file.  Below is default recommended settings:

```Text CampaignConfig.json

    "Please note": "<true/false>, for cordova build.  True for release build, false for beta build",
    "useRelease": false,

    "Required Mobile-Push plugins": "<true/false>, enable or disable plugin",
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-ios-notification-service": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-inapp": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-inbox": true,

    "Optional Mobile-Push plugins": "<true/false>, enable or disable plugin",
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-action-menu": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-beacon": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-calendar": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-dial": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-displayweb": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-geofence": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-location": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-passbook": true,
    "cordova-acoustic-mobile-push-plugin-snooze": true
  },
```

2. Run node.js command to automatically install from project folder

```Text shell

```
